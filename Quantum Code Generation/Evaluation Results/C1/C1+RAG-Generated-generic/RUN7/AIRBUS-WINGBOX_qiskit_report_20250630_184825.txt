Circuit Summary:
--------------------
The circuit is composed of 4 qubits and includes a series of Ry, H, P, RZ, and CNOT gates. The gates are applied to the qubits in a specific sequence, with some gates having parameters such as rotation angles. The circuit involves multiple controlled operations (CNOT) and single-qubit rotations.

Explanation:
---------------
The provided code defines a quantum circuit using Qiskit based on the UML model. The circuit consists of 4 qubits and a sequence of quantum gates including Ry, H, P, RZ, and CNOT gates. The gates are applied in a specific order as described in the UML model, with parameters extracted from the model's attributes.

Dependencies:
---------------
- qiskit

Usage Instructions:
--------------------
To run the code, ensure you have Qiskit installed. You can execute the function `circuit1()` to obtain a QuantumCircuit object, which can then be simulated or run on a quantum device using Qiskit's Aer or IBM Quantum backends.

Qiskit Patterns Used:
--------------------
- QuantumRegister for qubit management
- QuantumCircuit for circuit construction
- Standard gates like Ry, H, P, RZ, and CNOT

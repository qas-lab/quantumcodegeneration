Circuit Summary:
--------------------
The circuit consists of a series of quantum gates applied to four qubits. It includes Ry, H, P, RZ, and CX gates, with specific parameters extracted from the UML model. The control flow follows a sequence of operations that involve rotations, phase shifts, and controlled operations between qubits.

Explanation:
---------------
The generated code defines a quantum circuit using Qiskit, based on the UML model provided. The circuit is constructed by mapping UML activity nodes to Qiskit gates, following the control flow specified in the UML. Each qubit is represented by a separate QuantumRegister, and gates are applied in the sequence dictated by the UML control flow.

Dependencies:
---------------
- qiskit

Usage Instructions:
--------------------
To run the code, ensure you have Qiskit installed. You can execute the function `circuit1()` to obtain a QuantumCircuit object, which can then be simulated or run on a quantum device using Qiskit's Aer or IBM Quantum backends.

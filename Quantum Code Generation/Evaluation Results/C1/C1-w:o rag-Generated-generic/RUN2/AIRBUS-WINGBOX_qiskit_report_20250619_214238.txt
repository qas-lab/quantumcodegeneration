Circuit Summary:
--------------------
The circuit consists of 4 qubits and applies a series of quantum gates, including Ry, H, U, P, RZ, and CNOT gates. The gates are applied in a specific sequence to manipulate the qubits according to the logic defined in the UML model.

Explanation:
---------------
The provided code defines a quantum circuit using Qiskit based on the UML model. The circuit consists of 4 qubits and a series of quantum gates, including Ry, H, U, P, RZ, and CNOT gates. The gates are applied in a specific sequence to the qubits as described in the UML model.

Dependencies:
---------------
- qiskit

Usage Instructions:
--------------------
To run the code, ensure you have Qiskit installed. You can execute the function `circuit1()` to obtain the quantum circuit object, which can then be used for simulation or execution on a quantum device.

Qiskit Patterns Used:
--------------------
- QuantumRegister for qubit management
- QuantumCircuit for circuit construction
- Use of parameterized gates like Ry, U, and P
- Controlled operations with CNOT

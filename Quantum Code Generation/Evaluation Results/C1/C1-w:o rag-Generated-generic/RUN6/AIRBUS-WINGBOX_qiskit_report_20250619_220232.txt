Circuit Summary:
--------------------
The circuit is composed of 4 qubits and involves a sequence of quantum gates including Ry, H, U, P, and CNOT. The gates are applied to the qubits in a specific order to implement the desired quantum logic as defined in the UML model.

Explanation:
---------------
The provided code defines a quantum circuit using Qiskit based on the UML model. The circuit consists of 4 qubits and a series of quantum gates applied in a specific sequence. The gates include Ry, H, U, P, and CNOT, with parameters extracted from the UML model.

Dependencies:
---------------
- qiskit

Usage Instructions:
--------------------
To run the code, ensure you have Qiskit installed. You can execute the function `circuit1()` to obtain the quantum circuit object, which can then be used for simulation or execution on a quantum device.

Qiskit Patterns Used:
--------------------
- QuantumRegister for qubit management
- QuantumCircuit for circuit construction
- Parameterized gates for dynamic gate application
- Controlled gates for entanglement

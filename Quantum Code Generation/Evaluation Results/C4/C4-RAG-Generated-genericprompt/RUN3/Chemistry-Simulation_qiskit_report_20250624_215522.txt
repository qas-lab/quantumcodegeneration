Circuit Summary:
--------------------
The circuit is a parameterized quantum circuit with 4 qubits. It applies Ry and Rz gates to each qubit, followed by a series of CNOT gates to entangle the qubits. The circuit ends with measurements of all qubits.

Explanation:
---------------
The generated code defines a quantum circuit for a quantum chemistry simulation based on the UML model. The circuit consists of 4 qubits, each initialized with Ry and Rz gates parameterized by θ and φ. The circuit includes a series of CNOT gates to create entanglement between the qubits, followed by additional Ry and Rz gates. Finally, the qubits are measured, and the circuit is returned by the ansatz function.

Dependencies:
---------------
- qiskit

Usage Instructions:
--------------------
To run the code, ensure you have Qiskit installed. You can execute the ansatz function to obtain the quantum circuit and use Qiskit's Aer simulator or a real quantum device to run the circuit.

Qiskit Patterns Used:
--------------------
- Parameterized circuits
- Entanglement with CNOT gates
- Measurement of qubits

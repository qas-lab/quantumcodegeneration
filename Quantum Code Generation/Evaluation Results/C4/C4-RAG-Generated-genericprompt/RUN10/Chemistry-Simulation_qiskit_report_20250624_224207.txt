Circuit Summary:
--------------------
The circuit starts with Ry and Rz gates applied to each of the 4 qubits, parameterized by a single angle 'Î¸'. It then applies a series of CNOT gates to entangle the qubits in a specific pattern. The circuit concludes with measurement operations on all qubits.

Explanation:
---------------
The generated code defines a quantum circuit for a quantum chemistry simulation called 'ansatz'. The circuit consists of 4 qubits and includes a series of Ry and Rz rotation gates, followed by a sequence of CNOT gates to create entanglement between the qubits. Finally, the circuit includes measurement operations to read the state of all qubits.

Dependencies:
---------------
- qiskit

Usage Instructions:
--------------------
To run the code, ensure you have Qiskit installed. You can execute the 'ansatz' function to obtain a QuantumCircuit object, which can be further used for simulation or execution on a quantum device.

Qiskit Patterns Used:
--------------------
- Parameterized circuits
- Entanglement with CNOT gates
- Measurement of all qubits

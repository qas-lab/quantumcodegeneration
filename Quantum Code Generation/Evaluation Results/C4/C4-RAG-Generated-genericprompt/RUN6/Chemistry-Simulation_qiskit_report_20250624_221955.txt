Circuit Summary:
--------------------
The circuit is a parameterized quantum circuit with 4 qubits. It applies Ry and Rz gates to each qubit, followed by a series of CNOT gates to create entanglement. The pattern of CNOT gates is repeated three times, and the circuit concludes with another set of Ry and Rz gates before measurement.

Explanation:
---------------
The generated code defines a quantum circuit for a quantum chemistry simulation called 'ansatz'. The circuit consists of 4 qubits, each initialized with parameterized Ry and Rz gates. The circuit includes a series of CNOT gates to entangle the qubits, followed by another set of Ry and Rz gates. Finally, the qubits are measured. The circuit is parameterized to allow for flexible rotation angles, which can be adjusted during execution.

Dependencies:
---------------
- qiskit

Usage Instructions:
--------------------
To run the code, ensure you have Qiskit installed. You can execute the 'ansatz' function to obtain a QuantumCircuit object, which can be further used in quantum simulations or executed on a quantum backend.

Qiskit Patterns Used:
--------------------
- Parameterized circuits
- Entanglement with CNOT gates
- Measurement of qubits

Circuit Summary:
--------------------
The circuit starts with Ry and Rz rotations on each of the 4 qubits, followed by a sequence of CNOT gates to create entanglement between the qubits. The circuit concludes with measurement operations to capture the final state of each qubit.

Explanation:
---------------
The generated code defines a quantum circuit for a quantum chemistry simulation. The circuit consists of 4 qubits, each initialized with Ry and Rz gates parameterized by a single angle theta. The circuit includes a series of CNOT gates to entangle the qubits, followed by measurement operations to read the qubit states into classical bits.

Dependencies:
---------------
- qiskit

Usage Instructions:
--------------------
To run the code, ensure you have Qiskit installed. You can execute the ansatz function to obtain a QuantumCircuit object, which can be simulated or run on a quantum device using Qiskit's Aer or IBM Quantum backends.

Qiskit Patterns Used:
--------------------
- Parameterized circuits
- Entanglement with CNOT gates
- Measurement operations

Circuit Summary:
--------------------
The circuit consists of four qubits, each initialized with a separate QuantumRegister. The circuit applies a series of Ry and Rz rotations to each qubit, followed by a sequence of CNOT gates that entangle the qubits in a specific pattern. The circuit ends with additional Ry and Rz rotations on each qubit.

Explanation:
---------------
The generated code defines a quantum circuit for a quantum chemistry simulation using Qiskit. The circuit is constructed based on the UML model, which specifies a sequence of quantum gates and CNOT operations across four qubits. Each qubit is represented by a separate QuantumRegister, and the circuit is initialized with these registers. The circuit includes a series of Ry and Rz rotations followed by CNOT gates, as specified by the UML activity diagram.

Dependencies:
---------------
- qiskit
- numpy

Usage Instructions:
--------------------
To run the code, ensure you have Qiskit and numpy installed. You can execute the ansatz function to obtain the QuantumCircuit object, which can then be used in a quantum simulation or executed on a quantum device or simulator.

Qiskit Patterns Used:
--------------------
- QuantumRegister initialization
- QuantumCircuit construction
- Ry and Rz gate application
- CNOT gate application

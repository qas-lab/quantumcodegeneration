Circuit Summary:
--------------------
The circuit consists of four qubits, each initialized with a separate quantum register. The circuit applies a series of Ry and Rz rotations to each qubit, followed by a sequence of CNOT gates that entangle the qubits in a specific pattern. The sequence of operations is repeated multiple times, reflecting the iterative nature of the quantum chemistry simulation.

Explanation:
---------------
The generated code defines a quantum circuit for a quantum chemistry simulation using Qiskit. The circuit is constructed based on a UML model that specifies the sequence of quantum gates and their application to specific qubits. The circuit includes rotations (Ry and Rz) and controlled-NOT (CNOT) gates, following the control flow defined in the UML activity diagram.

Dependencies:
---------------
- numpy
- qiskit

Usage Instructions:
--------------------
To run the code, ensure you have Qiskit and numpy installed. You can execute the ansatz function to obtain a QuantumCircuit object, which can then be simulated or run on a quantum device using Qiskit's Aer or IBM Quantum backends.

Circuit Summary:
--------------------
The circuit consists of four qubits, each initialized with Ry and Rz rotations. The qubits are entangled using a series of CNOT gates, following the control flow specified in the UML model. The circuit ends with additional Rz rotations on each qubit.

Explanation:
---------------
The generated code defines a quantum circuit for a quantum chemistry simulation using Qiskit. The circuit is constructed based on the UML model, which specifies a sequence of quantum gates and CNOT operations across four qubits. Each qubit is represented by a separate QuantumRegister, and the circuit is initialized with these registers. The circuit includes Ry and Rz rotations followed by a series of CNOT gates, as specified by the UML activity diagram.

Dependencies:
---------------
- qiskit
- numpy

Usage Instructions:
--------------------
To run the code, ensure you have Qiskit and numpy installed. You can execute the ansatz function to obtain the QuantumCircuit object, which can then be used for simulation or further processing in a quantum computing workflow.

Qiskit Patterns Used:
--------------------
- QuantumRegister initialization
- QuantumCircuit construction
- Ry and Rz gate application
- CNOT gate application

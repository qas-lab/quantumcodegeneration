Circuit Summary:
--------------------
The circuit consists of four qubits, each initialized with Ry and Rz rotations. The qubits are entangled using a series of CNOT gates, following the control flow from the UML model. The circuit concludes with measurements on all qubits.

Explanation:
---------------
The generated Python code defines a quantum circuit for a quantum chemistry simulation based on the provided UML model. The circuit is constructed using Qiskit, with each qubit represented by a separate QuantumRegister. The circuit applies a series of Ry and Rz rotations followed by CNOT gates according to the control flow and constraints specified in the UML model. Finally, all qubits are measured.

Dependencies:
---------------
- numpy
- qiskit

Usage Instructions:
--------------------
To run the code, ensure you have Qiskit installed. You can execute the ansatz function to obtain the quantum circuit, which can then be run on a simulator or quantum device using Qiskit's execute function.

Qiskit Patterns Used:
--------------------
- QuantumRegister
- QuantumCircuit
- ry
- rz
- cx

Circuit Summary:
--------------------
The circuit consists of four qubits, each initialized with Ry and Rz rotations. The qubits are entangled using a series of CNOT gates, forming a linear chain of entanglement. The circuit concludes with measurement operations on all qubits.

Explanation:
---------------
The generated code defines a quantum circuit for a quantum chemistry simulation using Qiskit. The circuit is constructed based on a UML model that specifies the sequence of quantum operations. The circuit consists of four qubits, each represented by a separate QuantumRegister. The circuit applies a series of Ry and Rz rotations followed by CNOT gates to entangle the qubits. Finally, all qubits are measured.

Dependencies:
---------------
- qiskit
- numpy

Usage Instructions:
--------------------
To run the code, ensure you have Qiskit and numpy installed. You can execute the ansatz function to obtain a QuantumCircuit object, which can be simulated or run on a quantum device using Qiskit's Aer or IBM Quantum services.

Qiskit Patterns Used:
--------------------
- QuantumRegister for individual qubits
- QuantumCircuit initialization with multiple registers
- Parameterized gates with numpy
- Measurement of all qubits

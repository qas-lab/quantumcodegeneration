Circuit Summary:
--------------------
The circuit consists of four qubits initialized in separate registers. It applies a series of Ry and Rz gates to each qubit, followed by a sequence of CNOT gates to create entanglement between the qubits. The circuit concludes with measurement operations on all qubits.

Explanation:
---------------
The generated code defines a quantum circuit for a quantum chemistry simulation using Qiskit. The circuit is constructed based on the UML model provided, which specifies a sequence of quantum gates and operations. The circuit includes four qubits, each represented by a separate QuantumRegister. The circuit applies a series of Ry and Rz rotations followed by CNOT gates to entangle the qubits. Finally, all qubits are measured.

Dependencies:
---------------
- qiskit
- numpy

Usage Instructions:
--------------------
To run the code, ensure you have Qiskit and numpy installed. You can execute the ansatz function to obtain the quantum circuit, which can then be run on a quantum simulator or real quantum hardware using Qiskit's execution functions.

Qiskit Patterns Used:
--------------------
- QuantumRegister for individual qubits
- QuantumCircuit initialization with multiple registers
- Application of parameterized gates (Ry, Rz)
- Entanglement using CNOT gates
- Measurement of all qubits

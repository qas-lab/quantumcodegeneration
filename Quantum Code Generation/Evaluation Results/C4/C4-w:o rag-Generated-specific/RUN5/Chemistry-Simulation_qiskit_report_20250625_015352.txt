Circuit Summary:
--------------------
The circuit consists of four qubits, each initialized with Ry and Rz rotations. The qubits are entangled using a series of CNOT gates, forming a linear chain of entanglement. The circuit concludes with measurements on all qubits.

Explanation:
---------------
The generated Python code defines a quantum circuit for a quantum chemistry simulation. The circuit is constructed using Qiskit, with four qubits represented by separate quantum registers. The circuit applies a series of Ry and Rz rotations followed by CNOT gates to entangle the qubits. Finally, all qubits are measured.

Dependencies:
---------------
- qiskit
- numpy

Usage Instructions:
--------------------
To run the code, ensure you have Qiskit and numpy installed. You can execute the ansatz function to obtain the quantum circuit, which can then be run on a quantum simulator or real quantum device using Qiskit's execution functions.

Qiskit Patterns Used:
--------------------
- QuantumRegister for individual qubits
- QuantumCircuit for circuit construction
- ry and rz for rotation gates
- cx for CNOT gates
- measure_all for final measurements

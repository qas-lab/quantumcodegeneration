Circuit Summary:
--------------------
The circuit starts with Ry and Rz rotations on each qubit, followed by a series of CNOT gates to entangle the qubits in a linear fashion. This pattern is repeated three times, and the circuit concludes with measurements on all qubits.

Explanation:
---------------
The generated Python code defines a function `ansatz()` that constructs a quantum circuit using Qiskit. The circuit consists of four qubits and includes a series of Ry and Rz rotations with a fixed angle of pi/2, followed by a sequence of CNOT gates to create entanglement between the qubits. Finally, the circuit measures all qubits.

Dependencies:
---------------
- qiskit
- math

Usage Instructions:
--------------------
To run the code, ensure you have Qiskit installed. You can execute the `ansatz()` function to obtain a QuantumCircuit object, which can then be run on a simulator or quantum device using Qiskit's execution functions.

Qiskit Patterns Used:
--------------------
- QuantumCircuit construction
- Parameterized gates
- Entanglement with CNOT
- Measurement

Circuit Summary:
--------------------
The circuit applies parameterized Ry and Rz gates to each of the 4 qubits, followed by a series of CNOT gates to create entanglement. The sequence of gates is repeated three times, and the circuit ends with measurements of all qubits.

Explanation:
---------------
The generated code defines a quantum circuit for a quantum chemistry simulation called 'ansatz'. The circuit consists of 4 qubits and 4 classical bits. It applies a series of parameterized Ry and Rz gates to each qubit, followed by a sequence of CNOT gates to entangle the qubits. The circuit concludes with additional Ry and Rz gates and measures all qubits.

Dependencies:
---------------
- qiskit
- qiskit.circuit.Parameter

Usage Instructions:
--------------------
To run the code, ensure you have Qiskit installed. You can execute the ansatz function to obtain a QuantumCircuit object, which can be run on a simulator or a real quantum device using Qiskit's execution functions.

Qiskit Patterns Used:
--------------------
- Parameterized circuits
- Entanglement with CNOT gates
- Measurement of qubits

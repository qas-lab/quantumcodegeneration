Circuit Summary:
--------------------
The circuit is a parameterized quantum circuit designed for quantum chemistry simulations. It includes rotation gates (Ry and Rz) applied to each qubit, followed by a series of CNOT gates to create entanglement. The circuit is finalized with measurements of all qubits.

Explanation:
---------------
The generated Python code defines a function `ansatz()` that constructs a quantum circuit using Qiskit. The circuit consists of 4 qubits and 4 classical bits. It applies parameterized Ry and Rz rotation gates to each qubit, followed by a series of CNOT gates to entangle the qubits. The circuit concludes with additional Ry and Rz gates and measures all qubits, storing the results in classical bits.

Dependencies:
---------------
- qiskit
- qiskit.circuit.Parameter

Usage Instructions:
--------------------
To run the code, ensure you have Qiskit installed. You can execute the `ansatz()` function to obtain a QuantumCircuit object, which can be further used in quantum simulations or executed on a quantum simulator or real quantum device.

Qiskit Patterns Used:
--------------------
- Parameterized circuits
- Entanglement with CNOT gates
- Measurement of qubits

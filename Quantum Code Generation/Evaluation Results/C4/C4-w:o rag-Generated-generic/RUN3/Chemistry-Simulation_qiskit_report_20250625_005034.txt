Circuit Summary:
--------------------
The circuit begins with Ry and Rz gates applied to each of the 4 qubits, parameterized by a single angle theta. It then applies a series of CNOT gates to create entanglement between the qubits. The sequence of CNOT gates is repeated three times, followed by additional Ry and Rz gates. Finally, the circuit measures all qubits.

Explanation:
---------------
The generated Python code defines a quantum circuit for a quantum chemistry simulation. The circuit, named 'ansatz', is constructed using Qiskit and consists of 4 qubits. The circuit applies a series of Ry and Rz rotation gates, followed by a sequence of CNOT gates to entangle the qubits. The circuit concludes with measurement operations on all qubits.

Dependencies:
---------------
- qiskit

Usage Instructions:
--------------------
To run the code, ensure you have Qiskit installed. You can execute the ansatz function to obtain a QuantumCircuit object, which can be run on a simulator or a real quantum device using Qiskit's execute function.

Qiskit Patterns Used:
--------------------
- Parameterized circuits
- Entanglement with CNOT gates
- Measurement of qubits

Circuit Summary:
--------------------
The circuit is composed of four qubits, each undergoing a series of Ry and Rz rotations with an angle of pi/2. These rotations are interleaved with CNOT gates applied between consecutive qubits (q0-q1, q1-q2, q2-q3) to create entanglement. This pattern is repeated three times, followed by a final layer of rotations.

Explanation:
---------------
The generated Python code defines a function `ansatz()` that constructs a quantum circuit for a vehicle routing problem. The circuit consists of four qubits and multiple layers of Ry and Rz rotations, interleaved with CNOT gates. The rotations are parameterized with an angle of pi/2, and the CNOT gates are applied between consecutive qubits to create entanglement.

Dependencies:
---------------
- qiskit
- math

Usage Instructions:
--------------------
To run the code, ensure you have Qiskit installed. You can execute the `ansatz()` function to obtain the quantum circuit, which can then be simulated or run on a quantum device using Qiskit's execution backends.

Qiskit Patterns Used:
--------------------
- QuantumCircuit construction
- Parameterized gates
- Entanglement with CNOT gates
- Layered ansatz design

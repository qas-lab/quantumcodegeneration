Circuit Summary:
--------------------
The circuit consists of four qubits and is structured in multiple layers. Each layer includes Ry and Rz rotations on all qubits, followed by a series of CNOT gates that entangle adjacent qubits. This pattern is repeated three times, creating a deep entanglement structure suitable for variational quantum algorithms.

Explanation:
---------------
The generated Python code defines a function `ansatz()` that constructs a quantum circuit using Qiskit. The circuit is designed for a vehicle routing problem and consists of a sequence of Ry and Rz rotations followed by CNOT gates. The circuit is structured in layers, with each layer applying rotations and entangling operations across four qubits.

Dependencies:
---------------
- qiskit

Usage Instructions:
--------------------
To run the code, ensure you have Qiskit installed. You can execute the `ansatz()` function to obtain a QuantumCircuit object, which can then be used in a quantum algorithm or simulated using Qiskit's simulators.

Qiskit Patterns Used:
--------------------
- Layered circuit design
- Parameterized gates
- Entanglement with CNOT gates

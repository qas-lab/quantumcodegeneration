Circuit Summary:
--------------------
The circuit consists of 4 qubits, each initialized with Ry and Rz gates. The qubits are entangled using a series of CNOT gates in a pattern that repeats three times. This structure is designed to explore the solution space of a quantum problem, such as the vehicle routing problem.

Explanation:
---------------
The generated code defines a quantum circuit with 4 qubits, where each qubit undergoes a series of Ry and Rz rotations parameterized by a single angle Î¸. The circuit also includes a sequence of CNOT gates that entangle the qubits in a specific pattern, as described in the UML model. This pattern is repeated three times, creating a layered structure typical in quantum ansatz circuits.

Dependencies:
---------------
- qiskit

Usage Instructions:
--------------------
To run the code, ensure you have Qiskit installed. You can execute the ansatz function to obtain a QuantumCircuit object, which can then be simulated or run on a quantum device using Qiskit's Aer or IBM Quantum services.

Qiskit Patterns Used:
--------------------
- Parameterized circuits
- Layered ansatz structure
- Entanglement with CNOT gates

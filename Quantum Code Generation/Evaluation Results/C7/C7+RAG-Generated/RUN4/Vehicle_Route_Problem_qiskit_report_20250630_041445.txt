Circuit Summary:
--------------------
The circuit is composed of parameterized Ry and Rz gates applied to each of the 4 qubits, followed by a series of CNOT gates that entangle the qubits in a specific pattern. This pattern is repeated three times, creating a layered structure that is typical in variational quantum algorithms.

Explanation:
---------------
The generated code defines a quantum circuit for a vehicle routing problem ansatz. The circuit consists of 4 qubits and includes parameterized Ry and Rz rotation gates applied to each qubit. The circuit also includes a series of CNOT gates that create entanglement between the qubits, following the sequence specified in the UML model.

Dependencies:
---------------
- qiskit
- qiskit.circuit.Parameter

Usage Instructions:
--------------------
To run the code, ensure you have Qiskit installed. You can execute the ansatz function to obtain a QuantumCircuit object, which can then be used in a quantum algorithm or simulated using a Qiskit backend.

Qiskit Patterns Used:
--------------------
- Parameterized circuits
- Layered ansatz structure
- Entanglement with CNOT gates

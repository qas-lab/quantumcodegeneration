Circuit Summary:
--------------------
The circuit is composed of 4 qubits, each undergoing a Ry and Rz rotation with a parameterized angle. The qubits are entangled using a series of CNOT gates, forming a chain of entanglements from q0 to q3. This pattern is repeated three times, creating a layered structure typical in variational quantum algorithms.

Explanation:
---------------
The generated Python code defines a quantum circuit for a vehicle routing problem ansatz. The circuit consists of 4 qubits and includes a series of Ry and Rz rotation gates, each parameterized by a single angle Î¸. The circuit also includes a sequence of CNOT gates that entangle the qubits in a specific pattern, as described in the UML model.

Dependencies:
---------------
- qiskit
- qiskit.circuit.Parameter

Usage Instructions:
--------------------
To run the code, ensure you have Qiskit installed. You can execute the ansatz function to obtain a QuantumCircuit object, which can be further used in quantum algorithms or simulations. Use the QuantumCircuit.draw() method to visualize the circuit.

Qiskit Patterns Used:
--------------------
- Parameterized gates
- Layered entanglement structure
- QuantumCircuit object creation

Circuit Summary:
--------------------
The circuit consists of four qubits (q0, q1, q2, q3) and includes a series of Ry and Rz gates applied to each qubit. The circuit also includes CNOT gates that connect the qubits in a specific order: q0 to q1, q1 to q2, and q2 to q3. This sequence is repeated multiple times as specified in the UML model.

Explanation:
---------------
The generated code defines a quantum circuit for a vehicle routing problem using Qiskit. The circuit is constructed based on a UML model that specifies quantum gates and their sequence. The circuit consists of four qubits, each represented by a separate QuantumRegister. The circuit applies a series of Ry and Rz rotations with a fixed angle of pi/2, followed by a sequence of CNOT gates that connect the qubits according to specified constraints.

Dependencies:
---------------
- qiskit
- math

Usage Instructions:
--------------------
To run the code, ensure you have Qiskit installed. You can execute the ansatz function to obtain the quantum circuit and then use Qiskit's visualization tools to view the circuit or run it on a simulator or quantum device.

Circuit Summary:
--------------------
The circuit consists of four qubits (q0, q1, q2, q3) and includes a sequence of Ry and Rz rotations with an angle of pi/2 applied to each qubit. The circuit also includes a series of CNOT gates that connect the qubits in a specific order, following the constraints and control flow defined in the UML model.

Explanation:
---------------
The generated Python code defines a function `ansatz()` that constructs a quantum circuit using Qiskit. The circuit is based on a UML model representing a vehicle routing problem. The model specifies a sequence of quantum gates and CNOT operations across four qubits. The function initializes four quantum registers, each representing a qubit, and applies a series of Ry and Rz rotations followed by CNOT gates according to the control flow and constraints defined in the UML model.

Dependencies:
---------------
- qiskit
- math

Usage Instructions:
--------------------
To run the code, ensure you have Qiskit installed. You can execute the `ansatz()` function to obtain a QuantumCircuit object, which can then be simulated or run on a quantum device using Qiskit's Aer or IBM Quantum backends.

Qiskit Patterns Used:
--------------------
- QuantumCircuit initialization
- QuantumRegister usage
- Gate application with parameters
- Control flow mapping to CNOT gates

Circuit Summary:
--------------------
The circuit consists of four qubits and applies a series of Ry and Rz gates with a rotation angle of pi/2 to each qubit. It also includes a sequence of CNOT gates that connect the qubits in a specific order, following the control flow and constraints defined in the UML model.

Explanation:
---------------
The generated Python code defines a function `ansatz()` that constructs a quantum circuit using Qiskit. The circuit is based on a UML model representing a vehicle routing problem. The circuit consists of four qubits, each represented by a separate QuantumRegister. The circuit applies a series of Ry and Rz rotations with an angle of pi/2 to each qubit, followed by a sequence of CNOT gates connecting the qubits according to the constraints specified in the UML model.

Dependencies:
---------------
- qiskit
- math

Usage Instructions:
--------------------
To run the code, ensure you have Qiskit installed. You can execute the `ansatz()` function to obtain the quantum circuit, which can then be used in simulations or on a quantum device. Use `circuit.draw()` to visualize the circuit.

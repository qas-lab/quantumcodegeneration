Circuit Summary:
--------------------
The circuit consists of a sequence of Ry and Rz rotations on four qubits, followed by a series of CNOT gates connecting the qubits in a linear fashion. The control flow follows the UML model's activity diagram, ensuring the correct sequence of operations.

Explanation:
---------------
The generated code defines a quantum circuit for a vehicle routing problem using Qiskit. The circuit is constructed based on a UML model that specifies quantum gates and their sequence. The circuit includes rotations around the Y and Z axes and CNOT gates between specified qubits.

Dependencies:
---------------
- qiskit
- math

Usage Instructions:
--------------------
To run the code, ensure you have Qiskit installed. Import the ansatz function and call it to get the QuantumCircuit object. You can then use Qiskit's visualization tools to draw the circuit or execute it on a simulator or quantum device.

Qiskit Patterns Used:
--------------------
- QuantumCircuit construction
- QuantumRegister usage
- Gate application with parameters
- Control flow mapping from UML to Qiskit

Circuit Summary:
--------------------
The circuit consists of four qubits, each initialized with a separate quantum register. The circuit applies a series of Ry and Rz rotations with an angle of pi/2 to each qubit. It also includes a sequence of CNOT gates between qubits q0 and q1, q1 and q2, and q2 and q3, repeated multiple times as specified by the UML model.

Explanation:
---------------
The generated code defines a quantum circuit for a vehicle routing problem using Qiskit. The circuit is constructed based on a UML model that specifies quantum gates and qubit interactions. The circuit includes rotations around the Y and Z axes and controlled-NOT (CNOT) gates between specific qubits, following the control flow and constraints defined in the UML model.

Dependencies:
---------------
- qiskit
- math

Usage Instructions:
--------------------
To run the code, ensure you have Qiskit installed. You can execute the ansatz function to obtain the quantum circuit, which can then be simulated or run on a quantum device using Qiskit's execution backends.

Circuit Summary:
--------------------
The circuit consists of a sequence of Ry and Rz rotations with angles of pi/2 applied to four qubits, interleaved with CNOT gates that entangle the qubits according to specified constraints. The control flow follows a specific sequence of operations, ensuring the correct application of gates as defined in the UML model.

Explanation:
---------------
The generated code defines a quantum circuit for a vehicle routing problem using Qiskit. The circuit is constructed based on a UML model that specifies a sequence of quantum gates and CNOT operations across four qubits. Each qubit is represented by a separate QuantumRegister, and the circuit is built by following the control flow from the UML model, mapping each node to its corresponding quantum operation.

Dependencies:
---------------
- qiskit
- math

Usage Instructions:
--------------------
To run the code, ensure you have Qiskit installed. You can execute the ansatz function to obtain a QuantumCircuit object, which can then be simulated or run on a quantum device using Qiskit's execution backends.

Qiskit Patterns Used:
--------------------
- QuantumRegister for individual qubits
- QuantumCircuit construction
- Gate application using ry and rz methods
- CNOT gate application using cx method
- Use of math.pi for angle specification

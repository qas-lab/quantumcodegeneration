Circuit Summary:
--------------------
The circuit consists of four qubits and includes a sequence of Ry and Rz rotations with an angle of pi/2 applied to each qubit. The circuit also includes a series of CNOT gates that connect the qubits in a specific order, as defined by the UML model. The control-target pairs for the CNOT gates are determined by the constraints specified in the UML model.

Explanation:
---------------
The generated Python code defines a quantum circuit for a vehicle routing problem using Qiskit. The circuit is constructed based on a UML model that specifies quantum gates and their sequence. The circuit consists of four qubits, each represented by a separate QuantumRegister. The circuit applies a series of Ry and Rz rotations with a fixed angle of pi/2, followed by a sequence of CNOT gates that are defined by the UML model's control flow and constraints.

Dependencies:
---------------
- qiskit
- math

Usage Instructions:
--------------------
To run the code, ensure you have Qiskit installed in your Python environment. You can execute the ansatz function to obtain the QuantumCircuit object, which can then be used for simulation or execution on a quantum device. Use Qiskit's Aer simulator or a real quantum device to run the circuit and observe the results.

Qiskit Patterns Used:
--------------------
- QuantumRegister for individual qubits
- QuantumCircuit construction
- Applying Ry and Rz gates with fixed parameters
- CNOT gate application based on control-target constraints

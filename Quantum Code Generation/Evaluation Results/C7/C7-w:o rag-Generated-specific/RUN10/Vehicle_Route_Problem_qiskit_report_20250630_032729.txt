Circuit Summary:
--------------------
The circuit consists of four qubits, each initialized in its own quantum register. The circuit applies a series of Ry and Rz rotations with an angle of pi/2 to each qubit, followed by a sequence of CNOT gates that entangle the qubits according to the specified constraints.

Explanation:
---------------
The generated code defines a quantum circuit for a vehicle routing problem using Qiskit. The circuit is constructed based on an activity diagram from a UML model, where each activity node corresponds to a quantum gate and each partition represents a qubit. The circuit includes rotations (Ry and Rz) and CNOT gates, following the control flow specified in the UML model.

Dependencies:
---------------
- qiskit
- math

Usage Instructions:
--------------------
To run the code, ensure you have Qiskit installed. You can execute the ansatz function to obtain the quantum circuit, which can then be simulated or run on a quantum device using Qiskit's execution backends.

Qiskit Patterns Used:
--------------------
- QuantumRegister for individual qubits
- QuantumCircuit initialization
- Parameterized gates (ry, rz)
- Entanglement with cx (CNOT) gates

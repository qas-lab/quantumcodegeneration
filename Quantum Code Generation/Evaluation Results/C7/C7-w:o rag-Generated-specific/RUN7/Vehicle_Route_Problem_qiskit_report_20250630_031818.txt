Circuit Summary:
--------------------
The circuit consists of four qubits and applies a sequence of Ry and Rz gates with a rotation angle of pi/2. It also includes CNOT gates between qubits q0 and q1, q1 and q2, and q2 and q3, following the control flow and constraints specified in the UML model.

Explanation:
---------------
The generated Python code defines a function `ansatz()` that constructs a quantum circuit using Qiskit. The circuit is based on a UML model that represents a vehicle routing problem as a quantum circuit. The circuit consists of four qubits, each represented by a separate QuantumRegister. The circuit applies a series of Ry and Rz rotations with a fixed angle of pi/2, followed by CNOT gates between specific qubits as dictated by the UML model's control flow and constraints.

Dependencies:
---------------
- qiskit

Usage Instructions:
--------------------
To run the code, ensure you have Qiskit installed. You can execute the `ansatz()` function to obtain a QuantumCircuit object, which can then be used for simulation or execution on a quantum device.

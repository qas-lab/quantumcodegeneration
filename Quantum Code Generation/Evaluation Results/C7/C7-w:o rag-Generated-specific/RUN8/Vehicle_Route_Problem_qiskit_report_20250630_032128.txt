Circuit Summary:
--------------------
The circuit consists of a sequence of Ry and Rz rotations with angles of pi/2 applied to four qubits (q0, q1, q2, q3). It also includes CNOT gates between qubits according to specified constraints, forming a structured quantum circuit for solving a vehicle routing problem.

Explanation:
---------------
The generated code defines a quantum circuit for a vehicle routing problem using Qiskit. The circuit is constructed based on the UML model provided, which specifies a sequence of quantum gates and CNOT operations across four qubits. The circuit follows the control flow from the initial node through various quantum operations, including Ry and Rz rotations, and CNOT gates between specified qubits.

Dependencies:
---------------
- qiskit

Usage Instructions:
--------------------
To run the code, ensure you have Qiskit installed. You can execute the ansatz function to obtain the quantum circuit, which can then be simulated or run on a quantum device using Qiskit's execution backends.

Circuit Summary:
--------------------
The circuit begins by applying Hadamard gates to all four qubits, creating superpositions. It then applies phase gates with a phase of pi to each qubit. The circuit includes multiple CNOT gates, which are applied between various pairs of qubits, following the control flow specified in the UML model.

Explanation:
---------------
The generated Python code defines a function `circuit1()` that constructs a quantum circuit using Qiskit. The circuit operates on 4 qubits and applies a series of Hadamard (H) gates, phase (P) gates, and controlled-NOT (CNOT) gates. The sequence of operations is derived from the UML activity diagram, where each node corresponds to a quantum gate and the control flow edges determine the order of operations.

Dependencies:
---------------
- qiskit
- math

Usage Instructions:
--------------------
To run the code, ensure you have Qiskit installed. You can execute the function `circuit1()` to obtain a QuantumCircuit object, which can then be simulated or run on a quantum device using Qiskit's Aer or IBM Quantum backends.

Qiskit Patterns Used:
--------------------
- QuantumCircuit construction
- Hadamard gate
- Phase gate
- CNOT gate
- Qiskit Aer simulation

Circuit Summary:
--------------------
The circuit begins with Hadamard gates applied to all qubits, creating superposition states. It then applies phase gates with a rotation angle of 2 * (pi/2) to each qubit. The circuit includes multiple CNOT gates, which are controlled operations that entangle pairs of qubits, following the control flow defined in the UML model.

Explanation:
---------------
The generated Python code defines a function `circuit1()` that constructs a quantum circuit using Qiskit. The circuit consists of 4 qubits and includes a series of Hadamard (H) gates applied to each qubit, followed by phase (P) gates with a specific angle, and a sequence of CNOT gates between various qubit pairs.

Dependencies:
---------------
- qiskit
- numpy

Usage Instructions:
--------------------
To run the code, ensure you have Qiskit and NumPy installed. Import the `circuit1` function and call it to obtain the quantum circuit. You can then use Qiskit's simulation or execution tools to run the circuit on a quantum simulator or real quantum device.

Qiskit Patterns Used:
--------------------
- QuantumCircuit creation
- Gate application (H, P, CX)
- Use of numpy for parameterized gates

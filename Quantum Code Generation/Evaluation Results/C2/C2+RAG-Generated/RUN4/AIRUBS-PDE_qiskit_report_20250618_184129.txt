Circuit Summary:
--------------------
The circuit starts by applying Hadamard gates to all four qubits (q0, q1, q2, q3), creating superpositions. It then applies phase gates with a rotation angle of pi to each qubit. Finally, a series of CNOT gates are applied between pairs of qubits, implementing entanglement and conditional operations as specified in the UML model.

Explanation:
---------------
The generated Python code defines a quantum circuit using Qiskit, based on the UML model provided. The circuit consists of four qubits, each represented by a separate QuantumRegister. The circuit applies a series of Hadamard (H) gates to each qubit, followed by phase (P) gates with a specified angle, and a sequence of CNOT gates between various pairs of qubits. The sequence of operations is derived from the UML activity diagram, which maps activity nodes to quantum gates and partitions to qubits.

Dependencies:
---------------
- qiskit
- numpy

Usage Instructions:
--------------------
To run the code, ensure you have Qiskit and numpy installed in your Python environment. You can execute the function `circuit1()` to obtain a QuantumCircuit object, which can then be simulated or run on a quantum device using Qiskit's Aer or IBM Quantum backends.

Qiskit Patterns Used:
--------------------
- QuantumRegister for individual qubits
- QuantumCircuit for circuit construction
- Standard gate operations (H, P, CX)
- Use of numpy for mathematical constants

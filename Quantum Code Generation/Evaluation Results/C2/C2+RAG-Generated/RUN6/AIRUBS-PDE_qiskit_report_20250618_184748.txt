Circuit Summary:
--------------------
The circuit begins by applying Hadamard gates to all four qubits, creating superposition states. It then applies Phase gates with a rotation angle of pi to each qubit. Finally, a series of CNOT gates are applied between different pairs of qubits, implementing entanglement and conditional operations as specified in the UML model.

Explanation:
---------------
The generated code defines a quantum circuit named 'circuit1' using Qiskit. The circuit consists of four qubits, each represented by a separate QuantumRegister. The circuit applies a series of Hadamard (H) gates to each qubit, followed by Phase (P) gates with a specified angle of 2 * (pi/2). The circuit then applies a series of CNOT gates between various pairs of qubits as specified in the UML model.

Dependencies:
---------------
- qiskit
- numpy

Usage Instructions:
--------------------
To run the code, ensure you have Qiskit and numpy installed. You can execute the function 'circuit1()' to obtain a QuantumCircuit object, which can then be executed on a quantum simulator or real quantum hardware using Qiskit's execution functions.

Qiskit Patterns Used:
--------------------
- QuantumRegister for individual qubits
- QuantumCircuit for circuit creation
- Standard gate operations (H, P, CNOT)
- Use of numpy for mathematical constants

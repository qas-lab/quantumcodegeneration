Circuit Summary:
--------------------
The circuit consists of 4 qubits and includes a series of Hadamard gates applied to each qubit, followed by phase gates with a specific angle, and a sequence of CNOT gates that create entanglement between the qubits. The circuit is designed to prepare a specific quantum state as described by the UML model.

Explanation:
---------------
The generated Python code defines a function `circuit1()` that constructs a quantum circuit using Qiskit. The circuit is based on the UML model provided, which describes a sequence of quantum gates applied to four qubits. The circuit begins with Hadamard gates applied to all qubits, followed by a series of phase gates and CNOT gates as specified in the UML model.

Dependencies:
---------------
- qiskit
- math

Usage Instructions:
--------------------
To run the code, ensure you have Qiskit installed in your Python environment. You can execute the `circuit1()` function to obtain a QuantumCircuit object, which can then be simulated or run on a quantum device using Qiskit's Aer or IBM Quantum backends.

Qiskit Patterns Used:
--------------------
- QuantumCircuit construction
- Hadamard gate application
- Phase gate with parameter
- CNOT gate for entanglement

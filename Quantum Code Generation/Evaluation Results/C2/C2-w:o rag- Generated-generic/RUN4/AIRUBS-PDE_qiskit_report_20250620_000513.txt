Circuit Summary:
--------------------
The circuit begins by applying Hadamard gates to all four qubits, creating superpositions. It then applies parameterized phase gates to each qubit. The circuit includes a series of CNOT gates that entangle the qubits, following a specific sequence: q0 to q1, q0 to q2, q1 to q2, q0 to q3, q1 to q3, and q2 to q3. Additional phase gates are applied between CNOT operations to introduce specific phase shifts.

Explanation:
---------------
The generated Python code defines a function `circuit1()` that constructs a quantum circuit using Qiskit. The circuit is based on the UML model provided, which describes a sequence of quantum gates applied to four qubits. The circuit includes Hadamard gates, parameterized phase gates, and CNOT gates, following the control flow specified in the UML activity diagram.

Dependencies:
---------------
- qiskit

Usage Instructions:
--------------------
To run the code, ensure you have Qiskit installed. You can execute the function `circuit1()` to obtain a `QuantumCircuit` object, which can be further used for simulation or execution on a quantum device. Use Qiskit's Aer simulator or IBM Quantum Experience to run the circuit.

Qiskit Patterns Used:
--------------------
- QuantumCircuit construction
- Hadamard gate application
- Phase gate with parameter
- CNOT gate for entanglement

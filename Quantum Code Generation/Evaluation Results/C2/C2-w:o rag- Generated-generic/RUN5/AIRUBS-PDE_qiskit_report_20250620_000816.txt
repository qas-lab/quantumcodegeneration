Circuit Summary:
--------------------
The circuit begins with Hadamard gates applied to all four qubits, creating superposition. Phase gates are then applied to each qubit with a specified angle. The circuit includes a series of CNOT gates that entangle the qubits in a specific pattern, as defined by the UML model.

Explanation:
---------------
The generated Python code defines a function `circuit1()` that constructs a quantum circuit using Qiskit. The circuit is composed of 4 qubits and includes a series of Hadamard gates, phase gates, and CNOT gates. The Hadamard gates are applied to all qubits initially, followed by phase gates with a specific angle. The CNOT gates are applied between various pairs of qubits as specified by the UML model.

Dependencies:
---------------
- qiskit
- math

Usage Instructions:
--------------------
To run the code, ensure you have Qiskit installed. You can execute the `circuit1()` function to obtain a QuantumCircuit object, which can then be executed on a quantum simulator or real quantum device using Qiskit's execution functions.

Qiskit Patterns Used:
--------------------
- QuantumCircuit construction
- Hadamard gate application
- Phase gate application
- CNOT gate application
- Use of math library for angle calculations

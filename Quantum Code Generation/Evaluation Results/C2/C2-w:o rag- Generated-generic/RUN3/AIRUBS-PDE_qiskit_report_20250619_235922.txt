Circuit Summary:
--------------------
The circuit begins with Hadamard gates applied to all four qubits, followed by phase gates with a specific angle. It then performs a series of CNOT operations between various pairs of qubits, interleaved with additional phase gates. The circuit is designed to manipulate the qubits' states through entanglement and phase adjustments.

Explanation:
---------------
The generated Python code defines a function `circuit1()` that constructs a quantum circuit using Qiskit. The circuit is composed of 4 qubits and includes a series of Hadamard, phase, and CNOT gates. The sequence of operations is derived from the UML activity diagram, where each node corresponds to a quantum gate operation and the control flow edges determine the order of execution.

Dependencies:
---------------
- qiskit
- math

Usage Instructions:
--------------------
To run the code, ensure you have Qiskit installed in your Python environment. You can execute the `circuit1()` function to obtain a QuantumCircuit object, which can then be simulated or run on a quantum device using Qiskit's Aer or IBM Quantum backends.

Qiskit Patterns Used:
--------------------
- QuantumCircuit construction
- Hadamard gate
- Phase gate
- CNOT gate
- Interleaved operations

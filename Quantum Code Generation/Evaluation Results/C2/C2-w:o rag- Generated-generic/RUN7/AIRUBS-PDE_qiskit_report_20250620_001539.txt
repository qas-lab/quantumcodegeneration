Circuit Summary:
--------------------
The circuit consists of 4 qubits and a sequence of gates that include Hadamard gates on each qubit, phase gates with specific angles, and a series of CNOT gates between different pairs of qubits. The circuit is designed to manipulate the qubits' states through these operations, following the logic extracted from the UML model.

Explanation:
---------------
The generated Python code defines a function `circuit1()` that constructs a quantum circuit using Qiskit. The circuit is based on the UML model provided, which describes a sequence of quantum gates applied to four qubits. The circuit starts with Hadamard gates applied to all qubits, followed by a series of phase gates and controlled-NOT (CNOT) gates. The phase gates are parameterized with specific angles derived from the UML model. The CNOT gates are applied between various pairs of qubits as specified in the UML model.

Dependencies:
---------------
- qiskit
- math

Usage Instructions:
--------------------
To run the code, ensure you have Qiskit installed in your Python environment. You can execute the `circuit1()` function to obtain a `QuantumCircuit` object, which can then be used for simulation or execution on a quantum device. Use Qiskit's Aer simulator or a real quantum device to run the circuit and observe the results.

Qiskit Patterns Used:
--------------------
- QuantumCircuit construction
- Hadamard gate application
- Phase gate with parameter
- CNOT gate application

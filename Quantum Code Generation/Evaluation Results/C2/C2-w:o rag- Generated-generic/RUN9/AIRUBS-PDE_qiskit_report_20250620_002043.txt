Circuit Summary:
--------------------
The circuit starts by applying Hadamard gates to all four qubits, creating superpositions. It then applies phase gates with a phase of pi to each qubit. The circuit includes multiple CNOT gates, which are used to entangle the qubits. The CNOT operations are applied between various pairs of qubits, following the control flow specified in the UML model.

Explanation:
---------------
The generated Python code defines a function `circuit1()` that constructs a quantum circuit using Qiskit. The circuit is composed of 4 qubits and includes a series of Hadamard, phase, and CNOT gates. The sequence of operations is derived from the UML activity diagram, where each node corresponds to a quantum gate operation and the control flow edges determine the order of execution.

Dependencies:
---------------
- qiskit

Usage Instructions:
--------------------
To run the code, ensure you have Qiskit installed. You can execute the `circuit1()` function to obtain a QuantumCircuit object, which can then be simulated or run on a quantum device using Qiskit's Aer or IBM Quantum backends.

Qiskit Patterns Used:
--------------------
- QuantumCircuit construction
- Hadamard gate
- Phase gate
- CNOT gate
- Qiskit import and usage

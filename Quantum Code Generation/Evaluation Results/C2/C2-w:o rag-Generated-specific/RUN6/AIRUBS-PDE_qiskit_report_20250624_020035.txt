Circuit Summary:
--------------------
The circuit begins by applying Hadamard gates to all four qubits, creating superposition states. It then applies phase gates with a parameter of 2 * (pi/2) to each qubit. Finally, it performs a series of CNOT operations between different pairs of qubits, entangling them.

Explanation:
---------------
The generated Python code defines a quantum circuit using Qiskit, based on the UML model provided. The circuit consists of four qubits, each represented by a separate QuantumRegister. The circuit applies a series of Hadamard (H) gates to each qubit, followed by parameterized phase (P) gates, and concludes with a series of CNOT gates between various pairs of qubits. The parameters for the P gates are extracted from the UML model annotations.

Dependencies:
---------------
- qiskit
- numpy

Usage Instructions:
--------------------
To run the code, ensure you have Qiskit and numpy installed. You can execute the function `circuit1()` to obtain a QuantumCircuit object, which can then be run on a quantum simulator or real quantum device using Qiskit's execution functions.

Qiskit Patterns Used:
--------------------
- QuantumRegister for individual qubits
- Parameterized gates
- Entanglement with CNOT gates
- Use of numpy for mathematical constants

Circuit Summary:
--------------------
The circuit begins by applying Hadamard gates to all four qubits, creating superposition states. It then applies phase gates with a rotation angle of pi to each qubit. Finally, a series of CNOT gates are applied to entangle the qubits, following the control flow specified in the UML model.

Explanation:
---------------
The generated Python code defines a quantum circuit using Qiskit. The circuit consists of four qubits, each represented by a separate QuantumRegister. The circuit applies a series of Hadamard (H) gates to each qubit, followed by phase (P) gates with a specified angle, and concludes with a series of CNOT gates between various pairs of qubits. The code is structured to follow the control flow and gate operations as defined in the UML model.

Dependencies:
---------------
- qiskit
- numpy

Usage Instructions:
--------------------
To run the code, ensure you have Qiskit and numpy installed. You can execute the function `circuit1()` to obtain a QuantumCircuit object, which can then be executed on a quantum simulator or real quantum hardware using Qiskit's execution functions.

Qiskit Patterns Used:
--------------------
- QuantumRegister for individual qubits
- QuantumCircuit for circuit definition
- Hadamard gate application
- Phase gate with parameter
- CNOT gate for entanglement

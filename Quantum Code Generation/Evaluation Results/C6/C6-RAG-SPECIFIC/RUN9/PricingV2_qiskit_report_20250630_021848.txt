Circuit Summary:
--------------------
The circuit consists of three qubits (q0, q1, q2) and a sequence of Ry rotations and CNOT gates. The Ry gates are applied with specific theta values, and the CNOT gates are used to entangle the qubits according to the constraints defined in the UML model.

Explanation:
---------------
The generated code defines a quantum circuit for a European Call option using Qiskit. The circuit is constructed based on the UML model provided, which specifies the sequence of quantum gates and their parameters. The circuit involves three qubits and a series of Ry and CNOT gates, following the control flow from the UML activity diagram.

Dependencies:
---------------
- qiskit

Usage Instructions:
--------------------
To run the code, ensure you have Qiskit installed. You can execute the function `europeanCallQuantumCircuit()` to obtain the quantum circuit object, which can then be simulated or run on a quantum device using Qiskit's execution backends.

Qiskit Patterns Used:
--------------------
- QuantumCircuit construction
- QuantumRegister usage
- Ry gate application
- CNOT gate application

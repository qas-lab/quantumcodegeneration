Circuit Summary:
--------------------
The circuit consists of three qubits and a sequence of Ry and CNOT gates. The Ry gates are applied with specific theta values to each qubit, and CNOT gates are used to entangle the qubits according to the constraints specified in the UML model. The control flow follows a specific sequence from the initial node to the final node, ensuring the correct order of operations.

Explanation:
---------------
The generated code defines a quantum circuit for a European Call option using Qiskit. The circuit is constructed based on the UML model provided, which specifies the sequence of quantum gates and their parameters. The circuit uses three qubits, each represented by a separate QuantumRegister. The circuit includes a series of Ry rotations and CNOT gates, following the control flow and constraints defined in the UML model.

Dependencies:
---------------
- qiskit

Usage Instructions:
--------------------
To run the code, ensure you have Qiskit installed. You can execute the function `europeanCallQuantumCircuit()` to obtain the quantum circuit object. This circuit can then be simulated or run on a quantum device using Qiskit's execution and simulation tools.

Circuit Summary:
--------------------
The circuit initializes three qubits and applies a series of Ry rotations followed by CNOT operations. The Ry gates are applied to individual qubits with specified angles, and the CNOT gates are used to entangle the qubits in a specific sequence. This setup is typical for quantum algorithms that require state preparation and entanglement.

Explanation:
---------------
The generated Python code defines a function `europeanCallQuantumCircuit` that constructs a quantum circuit using Qiskit. The circuit consists of three qubits and a sequence of Ry and CNOT gates. The Ry gates are applied with specific angles to the qubits, and the CNOT gates are applied between pairs of qubits as dictated by the UML model's control flow.

Dependencies:
---------------
- qiskit

Usage Instructions:
--------------------
To run the code, ensure you have Qiskit installed. You can execute the function `europeanCallQuantumCircuit()` to obtain the quantum circuit object. This circuit can be visualized, simulated, or run on a quantum device using Qiskit's tools.

Qiskit Patterns Used:
--------------------
- QuantumCircuit initialization
- Ry gate application
- CNOT gate application
- Quantum circuit construction

Circuit Summary:
--------------------
The circuit implements a swap test using three qubits. It starts with a Hadamard gate on the first qubit, followed by a controlled swap operation between the second and third qubits, controlled by the first qubit. Finally, another Hadamard gate is applied to the first qubit.

Explanation:
---------------
The generated code defines a function `swap_test_quantum_circuit` that creates a quantum circuit for a swap test. The circuit uses three qubits, where the first qubit is used as a control qubit for a controlled swap (CSWAP) operation between the second and third qubits. The circuit begins and ends with a Hadamard gate applied to the control qubit.

Dependencies:
---------------
- qiskit
- numpy

Usage Instructions:
--------------------
To run the code, ensure you have Qiskit installed. You can execute the function `swap_test_quantum_circuit()` to obtain a QuantumCircuit object representing the swap test circuit. This circuit can be executed on a quantum simulator or real quantum hardware using Qiskit's execution functions.

Qiskit Patterns Used:
--------------------
- QuantumCircuit creation
- QuantumRegister usage
- Hadamard gate
- Controlled swap (CSWAP) gate

Circuit Summary:
--------------------
The circuit implements a swap test, which is used to determine the similarity between two quantum states. It uses three qubits: the first qubit is used as a control qubit, and the other two qubits hold the states to be compared. The circuit applies a Hadamard gate to the control qubit, performs a controlled swap operation, and then applies another Hadamard gate to the control qubit.

Explanation:
---------------
The generated code defines a quantum circuit for a swap test using Qiskit. The circuit involves three qubits and applies a Hadamard gate to the first qubit, followed by a controlled swap operation between the second and third qubits, controlled by the first qubit. Finally, another Hadamard gate is applied to the first qubit.

Dependencies:
---------------
- qiskit
- numpy

Usage Instructions:
--------------------
To run the code, ensure you have Qiskit installed. You can execute the function `swap_test_quantum_circuit()` to obtain a QuantumCircuit object representing the swap test circuit. This circuit can be executed on a quantum simulator or a real quantum device using Qiskit's execution functions.

Qiskit Patterns Used:
--------------------
- QuantumCircuit creation
- QuantumRegister usage
- Hadamard gate application
- Controlled swap (CSWAP) gate

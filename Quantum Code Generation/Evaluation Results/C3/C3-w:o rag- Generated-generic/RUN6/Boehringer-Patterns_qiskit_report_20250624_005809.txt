Circuit Summary:
--------------------
The circuit implements a SWAP test, which is used to determine the overlap between two quantum states. It uses three qubits: one as a control and two as targets for the SWAP operation. The control qubit is initialized with a Hadamard gate, followed by a CSWAP operation, and finalized with another Hadamard gate.

Explanation:
---------------
The generated code defines a function `swap_test_quantum_circuit` that constructs a quantum circuit for the SWAP test using Qiskit. The circuit involves three qubits, where the first qubit is used as a control qubit for a controlled-SWAP (CSWAP) operation between the second and third qubits. The circuit starts and ends with a Hadamard gate applied to the control qubit.

Dependencies:
---------------
- qiskit
- numpy

Usage Instructions:
--------------------
To run the code, ensure you have Qiskit and numpy installed. You can execute the function `swap_test_quantum_circuit()` to obtain a Qiskit `QuantumCircuit` object representing the SWAP test circuit. This circuit can be executed on a quantum simulator or real quantum hardware using Qiskit's execution functions.

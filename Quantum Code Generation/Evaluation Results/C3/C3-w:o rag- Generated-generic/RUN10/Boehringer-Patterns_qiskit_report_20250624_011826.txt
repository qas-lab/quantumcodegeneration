Circuit Summary:
--------------------
The circuit implements a SWAP test, which is a quantum algorithm used to determine the similarity between two quantum states. It uses three qubits: the first qubit is used as a control qubit, and the other two qubits represent the states being compared. The circuit applies a Hadamard gate to the control qubit, performs a controlled SWAP operation, and then applies another Hadamard gate to the control qubit.

Explanation:
---------------
The provided UML model describes a quantum circuit for a SWAP test using three qubits. The circuit begins with a Hadamard gate applied to the first qubit, followed by a controlled SWAP (CSWAP) operation where the first qubit controls the swap between the second and third qubits. Finally, another Hadamard gate is applied to the first qubit. This sequence of operations is implemented in the generated Python code using Qiskit.

Dependencies:
---------------
- qiskit
- numpy

Usage Instructions:
--------------------
To run the code, ensure you have Qiskit and numpy installed. You can execute the function `swap_test_quantum_circuit()` to obtain a QuantumCircuit object representing the SWAP test circuit. This circuit can be executed on a quantum simulator or a real quantum device using Qiskit's execution functions.

Qiskit Patterns Used:
--------------------
- QuantumCircuit creation
- QuantumRegister usage
- Hadamard gate application
- Controlled SWAP (CSWAP) gate application

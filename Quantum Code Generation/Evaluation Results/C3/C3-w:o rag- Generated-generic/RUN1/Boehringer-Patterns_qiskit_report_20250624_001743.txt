Circuit Summary:
--------------------
The circuit implements a SWAP test using three qubits. It starts with a Hadamard gate on the first qubit, followed by a controlled SWAP operation between the second and third qubits, controlled by the first qubit. The circuit concludes with another Hadamard gate on the first qubit.

Explanation:
---------------
The provided UML model describes a quantum circuit for a SWAP test using three qubits. The circuit begins with a Hadamard gate applied to the first qubit (q[0]), followed by a controlled SWAP (CSWAP) operation where q[0] is the control qubit and q[1] and q[2] are the target qubits. Finally, another Hadamard gate is applied to q[0]. This sequence of operations is implemented in the generated Python code using Qiskit.

Dependencies:
---------------
- qiskit
- numpy

Usage Instructions:
--------------------
To run the code, ensure you have Qiskit and numpy installed. You can create the circuit by calling the swap_test_quantum_circuit() function, which returns a QuantumCircuit object. This circuit can be executed on a quantum simulator or real quantum hardware using Qiskit's execute function.

Qiskit Patterns Used:
--------------------
- QuantumRegister for qubit management
- QuantumCircuit for circuit construction
- Hadamard gate application
- Controlled SWAP (CSWAP) gate

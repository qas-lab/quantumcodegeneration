Circuit Summary:
--------------------
The circuit implements a swap test using three qubits. It begins with a Hadamard gate on the first qubit, followed by a controlled swap operation between the second and third qubits, controlled by the first qubit. Finally, another Hadamard gate is applied to the first qubit.

Explanation:
---------------
The provided UML model describes a quantum circuit using an activity diagram where each node represents a quantum gate operation. The circuit is a swap test, which is a common quantum algorithm used to determine the similarity between two quantum states. The circuit involves three qubits: q[0] is used as a control qubit, while q[1] and q[2] are the target qubits for the swap operation. The circuit starts with a Hadamard gate on q[0], followed by a controlled swap (CSWAP) operation, and concludes with another Hadamard gate on q[0].

Dependencies:
---------------
- qiskit
- numpy

Usage Instructions:
--------------------
To run the code, ensure you have Qiskit and numpy installed. You can execute the function swap_test_quantum_circuit() to obtain a QuantumCircuit object representing the swap test circuit. This circuit can be executed on a quantum simulator or a real quantum device using Qiskit's execution functions.

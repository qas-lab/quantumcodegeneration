Circuit Summary:
--------------------
The circuit implements a swap test using three qubits. It applies a Hadamard gate to the first qubit, performs a controlled-SWAP operation between the second and third qubits controlled by the first qubit, and concludes with another Hadamard gate on the first qubit. This setup is used to determine the similarity between the quantum states of the second and third qubits.

Explanation:
---------------
The provided UML model describes a quantum circuit for a swap test, which is a common quantum algorithm used to determine the similarity between two quantum states. The circuit involves three qubits: q0, q1, and q2. The circuit starts with a Hadamard gate applied to q0, followed by a controlled-SWAP gate (CSWAP) with q0 as the control qubit and q1, q2 as the target qubits. Finally, another Hadamard gate is applied to q0. This sequence of operations is designed to measure the overlap between the states of q1 and q2.

Dependencies:
---------------
- qiskit

Usage Instructions:
--------------------
To run the code, ensure you have Qiskit installed in your Python environment. You can execute the function `swap_test_quantum_circuit()` to obtain a QuantumCircuit object representing the swap test circuit. This circuit can be further executed on a quantum simulator or a real quantum device using Qiskit's execution functions.

Qiskit Patterns Used:
--------------------
- QuantumCircuit creation
- Hadamard gate application
- Controlled-SWAP gate (CSWAP)

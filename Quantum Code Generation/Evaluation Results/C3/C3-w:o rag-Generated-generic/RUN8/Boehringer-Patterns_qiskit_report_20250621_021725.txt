Circuit Summary:
--------------------
The circuit implements a swap test using three qubits. It begins with a Hadamard gate on the first qubit, followed by a controlled-SWAP gate with the first qubit as the control and the second and third qubits as the targets. The circuit concludes with another Hadamard gate on the first qubit.

Explanation:
---------------
The generated Python code defines a function `swap_test_quantum_circuit` that constructs a quantum circuit using Qiskit. The circuit consists of three qubits and implements a swap test. The swap test is a quantum algorithm used to determine the similarity between two quantum states. The circuit starts with a Hadamard gate on the first qubit, followed by a controlled-SWAP gate (Fredkin gate) with the first qubit as the control and the second and third qubits as the targets. Finally, another Hadamard gate is applied to the first qubit.

Dependencies:
---------------
- qiskit

Usage Instructions:
--------------------
To run the code, ensure you have Qiskit installed. You can execute the function `swap_test_quantum_circuit()` to obtain a Qiskit `QuantumCircuit` object representing the swap test circuit. This circuit can be further executed on a quantum simulator or a real quantum device using Qiskit's execution functions.

Qiskit Patterns Used:
--------------------
- QuantumCircuit creation
- Hadamard gate application
- Controlled-SWAP (Fredkin) gate application

Circuit Summary:
--------------------
The circuit implements a SWAP test using three qubits. It starts with a Hadamard gate on the first qubit, followed by a controlled-SWAP gate with the first qubit as the control and the second and third qubits as the targets. Finally, another Hadamard gate is applied to the first qubit.

Explanation:
---------------
The generated code defines a function `swap_test_quantum_circuit` that constructs a quantum circuit for the SWAP test. The circuit uses three qubits, where the first qubit is used as a control qubit for a controlled-SWAP operation between the second and third qubits. The circuit begins and ends with a Hadamard gate applied to the control qubit.

Dependencies:
---------------
- qiskit

Usage Instructions:
--------------------
To run the code, ensure you have Qiskit installed. You can call the `swap_test_quantum_circuit()` function to get the quantum circuit object, which can then be executed on a quantum simulator or real quantum device using Qiskit's execution functions.

Qiskit Patterns Used:
--------------------
- QuantumCircuit creation
- Hadamard gate application
- Controlled-SWAP gate application

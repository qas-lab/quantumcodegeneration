Circuit Summary:
--------------------
The circuit consists of 4 qubits and includes a series of U gates for initialization, followed by a sequence of CNOT and Rz gates. The CNOT gates create entanglement between specific pairs of qubits, while the Rz gates apply phase shifts. The circuit follows a specific control flow as defined in the UML model, ensuring the correct order of operations.

Explanation:
---------------
The generated code defines a quantum circuit for the QAOA algorithm using Qiskit. The circuit is constructed based on the UML model, which specifies a sequence of quantum gates and operations. The circuit includes U gates for initialization, Rz gates for phase adjustments, and CNOT gates for entanglement between qubits. The control flow of the circuit is derived from the UML activity diagram, ensuring the correct sequence of operations.

Dependencies:
---------------
- qiskit

Usage Instructions:
--------------------
To run the code, ensure you have Qiskit installed. You can execute the function QAOAcircuit() to obtain the quantum circuit object. This circuit can be run on a quantum simulator or real quantum hardware using Qiskit's execution functions.

Qiskit Patterns Used:
